would like to start by thanking Dr. Nan Gao at Rutgers Newark for his
support and help with my paper. I am greatly indebted to his help and
support throughout. I extend my gratitude towards Dr. Patrick Morcillo,
my research advisor, for taking time despite his busy and tenuous
schedule to help me with my work. His constant support and words of
encouragement have meant the world to me even during the direst times. I
would also like to thank everyone at the Spolarics Lab at the New Jersey
Medical School for coaching me and for their insightful advice and
wisdom.

Furthermore, I would like to thank all my peers at NJIT for their
inspiration and a very memorable experience. I would also like to thank
my brothers at Sigma Pi for always lending an ear, listening to my
concerns, and virtually addressing them. Special thanks to Jackson Block
for putting up with my shenanigans and keeping hope always burning. I am
indebted to Professor Alamelu Venkataraman for our impromptu lectures
between her patient visits. Finally, I would like to thank my family for
their unwavering support. I could not have made it this far without
them.
