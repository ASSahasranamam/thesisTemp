I would like to thank Adrienne James for such an excellent \LaTeX\ style file.  It
does a great job of laying out my dissertation, so I can spend more time on
improving the content.  I would like to thank Steve Kunec for proofreading and making correction.  A special thank to Dr.\ Donald Knuth for inventing
\TeX.  Without \TeX, I probably have to fork out couple hundred dollars for
the privilege of typing my dissertation in Microsoft Word.  Nah, I would
probably borrow the Microsoft Office CDs from my sister's husband's
brother-in-law.
