    Sequential Organ Failure Assessment   score (SOFA score) & The SOFA   score is used to track a patient's status by determining the extent and   severity of a patient's organ function over time.

    Organ Dysfunction & A   significant change in the SOFA score by at least 2 points at a site remote   from infection, &  \\ \hline
    Septic Shock & A state of   sepsis that elicits a cascade of profound changes in the vasculature,   metabolism, cellular, and organ functions. &  \\ \hline
