Open the file thesis.tex, and to compile first create the .dvi, then .dvi to .ps, then .ps to .pdf.  Using pdflatex creates a file without the figure showing up. 

If using Windows, use XeLaTeX+MakeIndex+BibTex to compile the thesis.tex file. Using pdflatex will give an error in printing the figure.
