Infection &
  The invasion   of an organism by a pathogen that elicits a pro-inflammatory response &
   \\ \hline
Sepsis &
  An extremely   dysregulated immune response from the host in response to infection. &
   \\ \hline
Onset of Sepsis &
  Observation   of dysfunction in a new organ, away from the original site of infection &
   \\ \hline
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment   score (SOFA score) &
  The SOFA   score is used to track a patient's status by determining the extent and   severity of a patient's organ function over time. It uses data from the   Cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, and neurological organ systems   for calculation. &
   \\ \hline
Rapid   bedside organ dysfunction score – qSOFA &
  A quick test   that suggests potential Organ dysfunction if at least two of the following is   present: &
   \\ \hline
 &
  Altered Mental Status – Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 14 &
   \\ \hline
 &
  Systolic Blood Pressure ≤ 100 mmH &
   \\ \hline
 &
  Respiratory Rate 22 breaths per min &
   \\ \hline
Organ Dysfunction &
  A   significant change in the SOFA score by at least 2 points at a site remote   from infection, &
   \\ \hline
Septic Shock &
  A state of   sepsis that elicits a cascade of profound changes in the vasculature,   metabolism, cellular, and organ functions. &
   \\ \hline
PICS &
  Critically   ill patient &
   \\ \hline
 &
  Persistent inflammation &
  CRP \textgreater 50 μg/dL \\ \hline
 &
   &
  Retinol binding protein \textless 1 mg/dL \\ \hline
 &
  Immunosuppression &
  Total lymphocyte count \textless 0.80   ×109/L \\ \hline
 &
  Catabolic state &
  Serum albumin \textless 3.0 g/dL \\ \hline
 &
   &
  Creatinine height index \textless 80\% \\ \hline
 &
   &
  Weight loss \textgreater 10\% ‘or’ BMI \textless 18 during   hospitalization \\ \hline
